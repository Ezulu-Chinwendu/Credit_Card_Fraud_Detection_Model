This project employs a logistic regression model to predict fraud by analyzing features such as transaction distance, purchase ratio, and chip usage. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, reveals an imbalance with only 8.74% fraudulent transactions, prompting the application of machine learning techniques to improve model performance.
